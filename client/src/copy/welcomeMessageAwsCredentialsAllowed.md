On behalf of the Alces Flight Crew we’d like to welcome you on board the
Alces Flight Launch Service. This service has been developed to quickly
launch a preconfigured High Performance Computing (HPC) cluster. With the
Alces Flight Launch Service you gain immediate access to instant, single-user
scientific computing without the fuss of a full HPC set-up process.

This service can be operated in two ways: Through our time trialled Flight
Launch token program or through your own AWS credentials.

##### Using a Flight Launch token to access the service

Through one of the Alces Flight Crew or via one of our trusted partner
networks you should have a received a Flight Launch token consisting of
three unrelated words (ex. “flower – star – moose”). Don’t have one yet?
Contact us through this request form and we’ll start the process of securing
you a Flight Launch token.

Simply search through the available preconfigured clusters and, once you’ve
decided the HPC cluster you wish to trial, enter the token, the name you’d
like to give your cluster, and the email address you want to receive HPC
cluster updates to.

Once you press launch you are moments away from HPC cluster access!

##### Using your own AWS credentials

Using your own AWS credentials allows you to use Alces Flight compute
without risk of losing your work. This option is suitable for long running
evaluations or for performing your research.

To use Flight Launch with your own AWS credentials, you will need to have
configured an AWS account, and have your AWS access key ID and AWS
secret access key to hand. Don’t know where those items are located?
Here’s where you can access them.

Remember: Clusters launched through Flight Launch will incur costs against
your AWS account until you shutdown the HPC cluster. While we will keep
you fully informed of what clusters you request us to launch on your behalf,
you have responsibility for shutting down the cluster when you have finished
using it. Want to know how to shutdown an HPC cluster? Here’s how.

###### Using your preconfigured HPC cluster

Once you are notified that HPC cluster is active you can use either the
pre-determined time via Flight Launch token, or the time you allocate to the
cluster through your own AWS account, as you see fit. Work with the
applications that come pre-installed or try your hand at installing and
running any of the Alces Gridware Open Source applications available from this
list: https://gridware.alces-flight.com/

While we’ll send you plenty of emails letting you know your HPC cluster status
remember: Save your work and, if you are using your own account, remember
to shutdown the HPC cluster once your job is complete.

##### Getting ready to launch and more information

Want to spend some time reading up on the Alces Flight Launch service prior
to starting your project? We have a documentation site dedicated to the
cause as well as a Community Support Portal available for you to join in and
read through.

Enjoy your flight!
