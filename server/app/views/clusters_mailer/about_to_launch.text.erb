started launching, your AWS account will incur charges until the cluster is
shutdown.  Flight Launch will not shut the cluster down, it is your
responsibility to do so when you have finished using it.<% end %>

We will send you another email once your cluster is available for use.

We will send you another email once we have the AWS CloudFormation link for
