<p>Welcome on board the Alces Flight Launch Service.</p>

<p>
Your <%= @cluster_spec_name %> "<%= @cluster_name %>" will begin launching shortly.
<% if @using_token && @runtime_limit %>
    Once you are in flight, the evaluation period for this HPC cluster will be
    <%= @runtime %>.  Please remember to save your work as you go as once the
    trial completes the HPC cluster will shutdown automatically.
<% elsif @using_token %>
    You will not be charged for running this cluster, but <em>Alces Flight
        Ltd</em> reserve the right to terminate it without notice.  Please
    remember to save your work as you go.
<% else %>
    Once you are in flight your AWS account will incur charges.  The Alces
    Flight Launch Service is unable to automatically shutdown clusters, so
    please remember to close down your HPC cluster once your work is complete
    to avoid unwanted charges. (Unsure how to close down a cluster?  Click
    here for more details.)
