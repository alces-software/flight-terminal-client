Hi,

Your cluster "my-cluster" will begin launching shortly.  Once it has
started launching, your AWS account will incur charges until the cluster is
shutdown.  Flight Launch will not shut the cluster down, it is your
responsibility to do so when you have finished using it.

We will send you another email once we have the AWS CloudFormation link for
your cluster.


Please don't hesitate to contact us at <support@alces-flight.com> if you
have any questions!
