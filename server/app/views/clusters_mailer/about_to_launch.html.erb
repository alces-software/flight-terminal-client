<p>Hi,</p>

<p>
Your cluster "<%= @cluster_name %>" will begin launching shortly.
<% if @using_token %>
    You will not be charged for running this cluster, but <em>Alces Flight
        Ltd</em> reserve the right to terminate it without notice.
<% else %>
    Once it has started launching, your AWS account will incur charges until
    the cluster is shutdown.  Flight Launch will not shut the cluster down, it
    is your responsibility to do so when you have finished using it.
<% end %>
</p>

<% if @using_token %>
    <p>
    We will send you another email once your cluster is available for use.
    </p>
<% else %>
    <p>
    We will send you another email once we have the AWS CloudFormation link for
    your cluster.
    </p>
<% end %>

<% note do %>
    <p class="notes">
    You're receiving this email because you have started a cluster with Flight
    Launch.
