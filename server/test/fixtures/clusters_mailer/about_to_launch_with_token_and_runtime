Welcome on board the Alces Flight Launch Service.

Your small SGE bioinformatics cluster "my-cluster" will begin launching shortly.
Once you are in flight, the evaluation for this HPC cluster will be 4 hours.
Please remember to save your work as you go as once the trial completes the
HPC cluster will shutdown automatically.

You will receive another email shortly letting you know that the HPC cluster
is available for use.

Please don't hesitate to contact us at <support@alces-flight.com> if you have
any questions.

See you in the air soon.
