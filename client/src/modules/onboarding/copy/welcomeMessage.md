On behalf of the Alces Flight Crew we’d like to welcome you on board the Alces
Flight Launch service. This service has been developed to quickly launch a
preconfigured High Performance Computing (HPC) cluster. With the Alces Flight
Launch service you gain temporary access to instant, single-user scientific
computing at no cost to you.

The service begins the moment you enter your Flight Launch token for the HPC
cluster you wish to evaluate and ends after the pre-determined time period listed
on the HPC cluster information card.

##### How to use a Flight Launch token

Through one of the Alces Flight Crew or via our trusted partner
network you should have a received a Flight Launch token consisting of three
unrelated words (e.g. “flower – star – moose”). Don’t have one yet?  <a
href="mailto:flight@alces-flight.com?subject=Flight Launch Token
 Request&body=Please send me a Flight Launch Token by return
 email.%0D%0A%0D%0AKind regards." target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
Let us know</a> and we’ll start the process of securing you a Flight Launch
token.

Once you’ve secured a token simply search through the available preconfigured
clusters. When you’ve decided the HPC cluster you wish to trial enter the
token, the name you’d like to give your cluster, and the email address you
want to receive status updates to.

Then, simply press launch! You are now moments away from HPC cluster access.

##### Using your preconfigured HPC cluster

Once you are notified that your HPC cluster is active you can use the
pre-determined time as you see fit. Work with the applications that
come pre-installed or try your hand at installing and running
applications from the <a href="https://gridware.alces-flight.com/" target="_blank"
rel="noopener noreferrer">Alces Gridware open source application
library</a>.

While we’ll send you emails to let you know when your HPC cluster has
been launched, remember this is a trial service and is time
limited. Please remember to save any work you perform while using your
Flight Launch cluster!

##### Getting ready to launch and more information
