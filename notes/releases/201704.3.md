# Flight Launch release 201704.3

Flight Launch has had a number of releases pushed out since its first release.
I thought I'd collect together those improvements here.

## New features

It is now possible to use a "Flight Launch token" to launch a cluster.  Using
a launch token results in the cluster being launched on the Alces Flight AWS
account, allowing interested parties to try out Alces Flight Compute without
having to either create their own AWS account or incur any costs.

## Improvements

 1. Emails have been made prettier.
 2. Added an about page, privacy policy page, terms of service page and
    security page.

## Bug fixes

 1. Fixed some UI/UX issues when requests to launch a cluster fails.
 2. Fixed issue where the cookie banner could obscure the welcome message.
 3. Corrected spelling of CloudFormation.

## Minor improvements and other chores

 1. Upgraded to the latest fly.
 2. Added Google Analytics tracking which clusters are being launched.
 3. Improved build scripts.
 4. Added more tests.
 5. Made it harder to use non-Alces cluster specs with Flight Launch.
