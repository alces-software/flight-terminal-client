Flight Launch is a service provided by <a href="http://alces-flight.com"
target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Alces Flight</a> to quickly launch a
preconfigured Flight Compute cluster against your AWS account.  To use Flight
Launch, you will need to have configured an AWS account, and have your AWS
access key ID and AWS secret access key to hand.

Clusters launched through Flight Launch will incur costs against your AWS
account until they are shutdown.  We will keep you fully informed of what
clusters you request us to launch on your behalf, but you have responsibility
for ensuring that you shutdown the cluster when you have finished using it.

More information on using Flight Compute can be found on our <a
