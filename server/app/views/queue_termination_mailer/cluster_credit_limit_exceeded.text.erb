Your Alces Flight HPC cluster "<%= @cluster.cluster_name %>" has exceeded its compute
unit consumption limit.  All compute queues for the cluster will be terminated
shortly.

The cluster login node will continue running until <%= @cluster.grace_period_expires_at.strftime("%FT%T") %>
(<%= distance_of_time_in_words(@now, @cluster.grace_period_expires_at) %>), allowing you access to save any work.
After this grace period has expired, the cluster will be terminated.

During this grace period your cluster will continue to consume your compute
units due to the running login node.  Once you have saved your work, you can
terminate the cluster <<%= terminate_url(@cluster) %>>
to prevent any further consumption.

<% note do %>
    You are receiving this email because you have started an Alces Flight
    Compute HPC cluster with the Alces Flight Launch service.
