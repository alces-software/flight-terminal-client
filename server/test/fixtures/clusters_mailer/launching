Your Alces Flight Launch Service is in Taxi for Take-Off.

Your small SGE bioinformatics cluster "my-cluster" is being cleared for
take-off. You can view the progress of your HPC cluster on the AWS
CloudFormation console <https://eu-west-1.console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home#/stack/detail?stackId=arn:aws:cloudformation:us-east-1:700366075446:stack/flight-cluster-bens-test-2/a4c95470-099e-11e7-8ce5-500c217b4a9a>.

We will send you another email once your HPC cluster is in flight and
available for use.

Please don't hesitate to contact us at <support@alces-flight.com> if you have
any questions.

See you in the air soon.
