Your Alces Flight account has insufficient compute units remaining to continue
running all of your current clusters.  All compute queues for the clusters
below will be terminated shortly.

The clusters' login node will continue running for <%= @grace_period_in_hours %> <%= 'hour'.pluralize(@grace_period_in_hours) %>,
allowing you access to save any work.  After <%= @grace_period_in_hours %>
<%= 'hour'.pluralize(@grace_period_in_hours) %>, if you have not added additional compute units to your account your
clusters will be terminated.

The clusters affected are:

<% @clusters.each do |cluster| %>
  * <%= cluster.cluster_name %> -- <%= link_to 'terminate', terminate_url(cluster) %>
<% end %>

<% note do %>
    You are receiving this email because you have started an Alces Flight
    Compute HPC cluster with the Alces Flight Launch service.
