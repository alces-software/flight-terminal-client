Hi,

Your cluster "<%= @cluster_name %>" will begin launching on AWS shortly.  Once
it has started launching, your AWS account will incur charges until the cluster
is shutdown.  Flight Launch will not shut the cluster down, it is your
responsibility to do so when you have finished using it.

We will send you another email once we have the AWS CloudFormation link for
your cluster.

<% note do %>
  You're receiving this email because you have started a cluster with Alces
  Launch.
<% end %>
