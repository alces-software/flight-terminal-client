                                          A message from Alces Flight Launch.

Welcome on board the Alces Flight Launch Service.

Your small SGE bioinformatics cluster "my-cluster" will begin launching shortly.
Once you are in flight your AWS account will incur charges.  The Alces Flight
Launch Service is unable to automatically shutdown clusters, so please
remember to close down your HPC cluster once your work is complete to avoid
unwanted charges. (Unsure how to close down a cluster?  Click here for more
details.)

You will receive another email shortly letting you know that the HPC cluster
is available for use.

If you have any questions, please visit our Community Support Portal
<http://community.alces-flight.com>.

See you in the air soon.

The Alces Flight Crew
