Welcome on board the Alces Flight Launch service.

Your small SGE bioinformatics cluster "my-cluster" will begin launching shortly.
Once you are in flight, the evaluation period for your Alces Flight Compute
HPC cluster will be 4 hours.  Please remember to save your work as you go
as, once the trial completes, the cluster will shutdown automatically.

You will receive another email shortly letting you know that your Alces Flight
Compute HPC cluster is available for use.

If you have any questions, please visit our Community Support Portal
<http://community.alces-flight.com>.

See you in the air soon!

The Alces Flight Crew.
