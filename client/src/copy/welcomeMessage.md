Flight Launch is a service provided by <a href="http://alces-flight.com"
target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Alces Flight</a> to quickly launch a
preconfigured Flight Compute cluster.  There are two alternatives for
launching a cluster with Flight Launch.  You can either provide a Flight
Launch token or provide your own AWS credentials.

##### Using a Flight Launch token

Using a Flight Launch token allows you to evaluate Alces Flight compute risk
free.  With a Flight Launch token, you can launch a cluster without incurring
any costs; however, *Alces Flight Ltd* reserve the right to terminate the
cluster without warning, so make sure that any work performed on the cluster
can be safely lost.

##### Using your own AWS credentials

Using your own AWS credentials allows you to use Alces Flight compute without
risk of losing your work.  This option is suitable for long running
evaluations or for performing your research.

To use Flight Launch with your own AWS credentials, you will need to have
configured an AWS account, and have your AWS access key ID and AWS secret
access key to hand.

Clusters launched through Flight Launch will incur costs against your AWS
account until they are shutdown.  We will keep you fully informed of what
clusters you request us to launch on your behalf, but you have responsibility
for ensuring that you shutdown the cluster when you have finished using it.
