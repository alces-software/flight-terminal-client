You have Alces Flight HPC clusters that are approaching the end of their grace
period.

The clusters' login node will continue running allowing you access to save any
work.  After the grace period expires, if you have not added additional
compute units to your account your clusters will be terminated.

During their grace period your clusters will continue to consume your compute
units due to the running login node.  Once you have saved your work, you can
terminate the cluster to prevent any further consumption.

The clusters affected are:

<% @clusters.each do |cluster| %>
<%= cluster.cluster_name %>
  * Cluster name: <%= cluster.cluster_name %>
  * Grace period expiration: <%= cluster.grace_period_expires_at.strftime("%FT%T") %>
    (<%= distance_of_time_in_words(@now, cluster.grace_period_expires_at) %>)
  * Terminate now: <<%= terminate_url(cluster) %>>

<% end %>

<% note do %>
    You are receiving this email because you have started an Alces Flight
    Compute HPC cluster with the Alces Flight Launch service.
